Welcome to my academic homepage. I am a researcher in **AI-driven medical image analysis**, **multimodal learning**, and **large-scale vision-language models**, currently based at **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**. My research is focused on designing clinically useful algorithms that bridge 3D medical imaging and natural language reasoning.

### About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**, working at the intersection of **AI, medical imaging, and multimodal learning**.  
My long-term goal is to design **clinically meaningful and trustworthy AI systems** that connect 3D medical imaging with natural language reasoning, enabling more accurate diagnosis and interpretable clinical decision support.

**Research Areas:**
- 🧠 **3D Vision-Language Models** for CT/MRI interpretation and report generation  
- 🩻 **Zero-shot & Few-shot Diagnosis** for rare diseases and open-set evaluation  
- 🎯 **Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Reasoning**, confidence calibration, and decision making  
- 🔗 **Cross-Modal Feature Alignment** with token interaction optimization  
- ⚡ **Efficient Training & Deployment** with distributed systems and inference acceleration

### Highlights

- 🔬 **Med3D-R1**: Proposed a multi-stage reasoning framework for 3D medical VLMs, integrating abnormality reweighting and reinforcement learning.
- 🩻 **CT & X-ray Zero-shot Diagnosis**: Built CLIP-based models for large-scale chest imaging, achieving strong performance on open-set and rare disease benchmarks.
- 🧠 **Clinical Reasoning with RL**: Designed RL tasks for option filtering, diagnosis justification, and uncertainty calibration, improving trustworthiness of model outputs.
- ⚙️ **Scalable Training & Deployment**: Integrated **TensorRT-LLM**, **DeepSpeed**, and mixed-precision training, reducing inference latency by >40%.
- 📚 **Publications & Open Source**: Published in **CVPR, IEEE TMI, MIA**, and released reproducible code and datasets for medical AI research.
