Welcome to my academic homepage. I am a researcher in **AI-driven medical image analysis**, **multimodal learning**, and **large-scale vision-language models**, currently based at **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**. My research is focused on designing clinically useful algorithms that bridge 3D medical imaging and natural language reasoning.

### About Me

I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare, focusing on:

- 3D Vision-Language Models for CT and MRI
- Zero-shot and few-shot medical image diagnosis
- Reinforcement learning for clinical decision-making
- Cross-modal alignment and token interaction optimization
- Efficient large-scale training and deployment

I have developed several domain-specific models for **CT-based abnormality detection**, **medical report generation**, and **medical visual question answering (VQA)**. My work emphasizes both clinical value and technical innovation, integrating **abnormality reweighting**, **visual expert modules**, and **residual alignment mechanisms**.
